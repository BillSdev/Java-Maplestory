# Java-Maplestory
MapleStory clone developed in Java

I attempted to clone a certain 2D platformer game called Maplestory.

Tried to design the project in an Object-Oriented way as much as I could.

Some more newer features leave more to be desired in terms of design and implementaion because they where added on a whim a long time after I stopped working on the project.

When in game: 
              
              press 'O' to wear\remove shirt, 

              press 'L' to wear\remove pants,
              
              press 'P' to change face
              
              press 'F1',...,'F7' to make a face expression
              
              press 'X' to attack
              
              press 'F' to throw a cannon ball
              
              press 'V' to shoot a bullet
              
              Press 'W' to jump
              
              press left\right arrow to move left\right
              
              press 'Y' to open console
              
              press ESC to exit console
              
              
              console commands  :
              cannonangle x     -    x can only be an interger (for now),    change the angle at which the cannon is thown
              cannonvector x     -     x is an integer,  change the speed of the cannon ball
              cannongravity x   -   x is an integer,  change the gravity of the cannon ball
              press ESC after typing the command
