# Java-Maplestory
MapleStory clone developed in Java

This is the project I have invested the most time and effort in up to date.

I attempted to clone a certain 2D platformer game called Maplestory.

Tried to design the project in an Object-Oriented way as much as I could.

Some more newer features leave more to be desired in terms of design and implementaion because they where added on a whim a long time after I stopped working on the project.
